•Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? If so, let us know who you talked to and what sort of help you gave or received.


Our team was myself, Jacob Re, and Sonal Mogra. The code is a collaboration between us.


•Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for completing your assignment? Please provide a list.


Our main resource was the professor, who helped us during office hours and by email. We also used ChatGPT for help debugging. We also used Wikipedia at the beginning, but this proved unhelpful.


•Are there any known problems with your code? If so, please provide a list and, if possible, describe what you think the cause is and how you might fix them if you had more time or motivation. This is very important, as we’re much more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what’s going on.


1. The cylinders look very chunky and there are noticeable sections throughout it. Clearly the surface is getting swept slightly differently for each control point on the profile curve. 
2. The cylinders also all have one hole at a given control point on the profile curve. There’s probably an off by one error somewhere, especially if this is the first or last control point on the profile curve.
3. For surfaces of revolution, there seem to be extra surfaces being generated outside of the profile curve. I have no idea why this is. 


•Got any comments about this assignment that you’d like to share? Was it too long? Too hard? Were the requirements unclear? Did you have fun, or did you hate it? Did you learn something, or was it a total waste of your time? Feel free to be brutally honest; we promise we won’t take it personally.


The assignment was very challenging, especially since it was the first substantial one.
